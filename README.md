# STL Resolution Reducer 

[![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks/Stl-Resolution-Reducer)

The STL Resolution Reducer streamlines the process of decreasing the number of faces in STL files, enabling smoother animations for highly precise 3D mechanical simulation models, such as Simscape&trade; Multibody&trade;. This essential tool aids in visual verification and seeks to optimize the balance between simulation speed and rendering accuracy.

## Setup 
To set up STL Resolution Reducer, you have two options:
1. Run the `StlResolutionReducer.mlapp` directly in MATLAB.
2. Install the `StlResolutionReducer.mlappinstall` file.

### MathWorks Products (https://www.mathworks.com)
Requires MATLAB&reg; release R2024a or newer
- [MATLAB&reg;](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)

### 3rd Party Products:
No third-party products required.

## Getting Started
You can get started easily with the following four steps:
1. Select a folder which contains STL files.
2. Pick up a STL file.
3. Adjust the ratio to reduce faces in the STL file.
4. Overwrite the STL file.
